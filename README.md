# ISIS2

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/pgilad/ISIS2/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/pgilad/ISIS2)

Meaner, tougher, faster and more evolved version of [ISIS](https://github.com/DanielGorlo/ISIS.js)
Now includes testing as well.

This version also injects Islamic motivation into the console, removes the \<head\> tag, and warns America.
